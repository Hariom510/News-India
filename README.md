## Description
News India App is a real-time news application that provides up-to-date news and information from various sources across India. The app is built using React.js and utilizes a news API to fetch the latest news content. Users can browse through different news categories, view headlines, and read full articles based on their interests.

## Features
- Real-time news updates from a news API.
- React Router DOM for smooth navigation and distinct views for news categories.
- Stylish UI created with Styled-Components for a visually appealing experience.
- Responsive design for seamless usability on various devices.

## Demo
A live demo of the News India App is available at [https://imaginative-fudge-df214c.netlify.app/](https://imaginative-fudge-df214c.netlify.app/).

## Note: Live Link Issue - "There is a problem fetching the post data"
Please note that the API used for fetching news data is not free to use on shareable links or external domains. It is intended for localhost or local development purposes only. As a result, when accessing the app through the live link, the API requests are being blocked, and the news content cannot be retrieved.

To experience the full functionality of the News India App, we recommend running the application locally on your machine.
